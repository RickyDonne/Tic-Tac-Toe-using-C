# Tic-Tac-Toe-using-C
Tic Tac Toe game made in C

This game is played by two players in a 3 X 3 grid where the first player to get three row/column/diagonal same wins.
Player 1 uses X to mark it's move and player 2 use 0 to marks it's move on the board. 

This code will run fine in linux since i have used a linux exclusive command to clear terminal screen as system("clear").
If you want to run this in windows then use cls to clear terminal. 

I have used repetitive codes but you can improve the efficiency using a good algo.
